      						<p id="primoParagrafo">I was born in Reggio Calabria on the 23rd of March in 1990. I lived in Piale (a really small town) until I was 22 and this picture is what I used to see through the glass of my window.</p><p>
      						On my 18th birthday my classmates gave me a brand new iPod Touch and jailbreaking it was the beginning of my inane passion for mobile devices, Linux and all kind of technologies. </p>
      						<p>I started collaborating with the Italian blog <a href="http://www.androidworld.it" target="_blank"><b>Androidworld.it</b></a> on 2009 and since then I never quitted. </p><div id="rome"></div>
      						<p>After high school I started studying <b>Languages and literatures</b> at the University of Messina and on October 2012 I moved to Rome to attend a two years mobile development master in ELIS College. </p>
      						<p>
There I was able to get in touch with tons of programming language, framework and so on and I started developing my first Android apps. </p>
<p>
	I'm currently writing my thesis about <b>LIT</b> (<i>Language of Information Technology</i>) and the ways of translating its peculiar vocabulary. 
I speak Italian, English and Spanish. 
</p>
<p>
After all, I think I simply like to talk - to people or machine, it doesn't matter.
